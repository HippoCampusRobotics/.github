## Welcome to HippoCampus Underwater Robotics!

### Documentation
You can find our general documentation here: 
https://hippocampusrobotics.github.io/docs/

We also teach an "Intro to Underwater Robotics" class. You can find more information here:
https://hippocampusrobotics.github.io/fav_docs/

This class includes detailed ROS2 tutorials, assignments about general robotics algorithms (control, state estimation, path planning, ...). It's fully solvable in our open-source simulation framework -- feel free to try it out!
